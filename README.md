## Hackathon program

### Hackathon kickoff

**Research question and use cases** (1 hour)

- Brainstorming of a research question and a set of hypotheses
- Final formulation of a research project

**Introduction into Imaging and Postprocessing Software** (1 hour + 30 min)

- Introduction to FIJI ImageJ (reading imaging files, basic analysis). Analysis of a sample recording (stack). Median and avarage of a recording.
- Cell segmentation with Cellpose 3
- Extraction of calcium activity with suite2p

**Introduction to programming and data analysis** (1.5 hours)

- Warming up: what programming is and how it actually works?  Variables, functions, conditions, loops, arrays.
- Python libraries
- Use of AI. Code review and tests
- Examples of the code to read and plot the data
